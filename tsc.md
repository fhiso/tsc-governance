Technical Work
==============

FHISO's mission is to develop **open** and **international** standards
to benefit the genealogical community.

The FHISO Technical Standing Committee (TSC) is responsible for
coordinating the organisation's technical work through an open,
consensus-based, collaborative standards process.

With the consent of the Board, work is proceeding under a [simplified
governance structure](/governance), with much of the structure described
in the [TSC charter](/charter/) and [operations & policy manual](/opm/)
having been suspended.  Technical work is proceeding as a committee of
the whole supervised by the TSC.

At present the TSC has two members: Luther Tychonievich is the TSC
Coordinator, and Richard Smith is TSC Co-Coordinator.
We can be contacted by email at [tsc@fhiso.org](mailto:tsc@fhiso.org).

Get involved {#involve}
------------

We welcome participation from anyone, whether or not a member of FHISO,
who is willing to abide by our [code of
conduct](http://fhiso.org/aboutfhiso/code-of-conduct/). 

### Keep in touch

We recommend that all interested parties subscribe to the
[**tsc-announce** mailing
list](http://fhiso.org/mailman/listinfo/tsc-announce_fhiso.org), which
is a read-only low volume list where technical announcements are posted
by the TSC.

### Join the work

Current priorities for technical work are outlined in [the priorities document](/priorities) 
and discussed in detail in [the strategy document](/strategy).  Both
documents are subject to change as opportunities, resources, and member interest change.

Per our [interim structure](/governance/), technical work is proceeding 
as a committee of the whole.  The [**tsc-public** mailing list](tsc-public) 
is the primary means for communicating in this work.

Comments on [paper submissions](cfps/papers), the work of the TSC, and the
creation of future technical groups are also all welcome on the
[**tsc-public** mailing list](tsc-public).

### Submit papers

The FHISO is operating a [**call for papers**](cfps). This is our preferred
means of receiving technical proposals, suggestions for functional
requirements, or other detailed comment of the technical work of the TSC. In
due course we aim to consider all the suggestions made in these papers and
respond to them, but this will take time.

### Contribute to our bibliography

We are maintaining an [informal **bibliography**](/bibliography) of
material that might be useful to our standardisation work. Please email
[bibliography@fhiso.org](mailto:bibliography@fhiso.org) with suggestions
of what else should be included.
