Article 24: Extended Organisational Period
------------------------------------------

The initial period of operation of the FHISO shall be known as the
"Extended Organisational Period".

During the Extended Organisational Period, the Technical Standing
Committee will establish full functionality, and the Organisation's
Membership will become populated, balanced and diversified as to
multi-stakeholder interests and regional diversity. Once the Board has
determined by majority vote that these objectives have been achieved,
they will publicly announce that decision; said public announcement
shall be deemed to terminate the Extended Organisational Period and
Article 24 shall be stricken from the bylaws.

During the Extended Organisational Period, the Board shall have the
authority to create positions, delegate authority and fill vacancies.
The term of office of all elected Officers may be extended until the
Extended Organisational Period ends, after which they shall come up for
election per Article 15.

During the Extended Organisational Period, the Board may, as necessary,
amend the Bylaws to fully support organisational requirements by
majority vote of the Board without requiring a Special Resolution.  The
requirement to hold an Annual General Meeting is waived during the
Extended Organisational Period.

Proposed standards shall not be ratified as official FHISO standards
during the Extended Organisational Period.
