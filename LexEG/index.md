Lexicon Exploratory Group
=========================

The Lexicon Exploratory Group (or LexEG) is tasked with producing a
lexicon of common usage and best practices for genealogical terminology
in the English language. The [Technical Standing Committee](/) have
appointed Tony Proctor to be Coordinator of this group and provided the
group with [directives](directives) governing its operation. Tony
says:

> This Lexicon comprises a set terms & concepts that are currently in
> use in the genealogical domain by various parties, including its
> software, researchers, archivists, transcribers, etc. If there are
> different names for the same thing, or different meanings for the same
> name, then all would be included together with information about where
> each definition/usage originated. 
>
> A *preferred vocabulary* will eventually be needed before FHISO can
> publish material for external consumption, and ANSI/NISO Z39.19 may be
> relevant to that end. The interesting thing about a genealogical data
> standard is that there is no precedent, and hence no obvious place to
> insert it in the current classification of standards (see ICS). This
> implicitly means FHISO will need some terms for which there is no
> standard set or authoritative source. 
>
> In the meantime, the goal of the Lexicon is collect together the
> various terms currently in use, and differentiate them when there are
> different meanings/nuances, and correlate them when there are
> different words for the same concept.

To follow the work of the LexEG, you can subscribe to [their mailing
list](http://fhiso.org/mailman/listinfo/lexicon_fhiso.org).
Contributions to the lexicon should be sent there, preferably including
a source for its definition/usage if one is known. 

The working copy of the Lexicon can be found in their [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/fhiso/lexicon-eg). A snapshot of the
lexicon can be found [here](snapshot).
