List of Public Drafts
=====================

FHISO is currently working towards a suite of standards covering
citations and legacy data formats.  We are happy to announce that
several drafts have reached the point where we would like to encourage
comment and feedback from interested parties.  The [**tsc-public**
mailing list](tsc-public) is the preferred place for discussing this
work.

Citation Elements                                                 {#cev}
-----------------

Citation Elements: General Concepts

:  This document defines the general concepts used in FHISO's suite of
   Citation Elements standards, and the basic framework and data model
   underpinning them.
:  Read the [latest public draft](//fhiso.org/TR/cev-concepts) or 
   [download as a PDF](//fhiso.org/TR/cev-concepts.pdf).

Citation Elements: Bindings for RDFa

:  This document defines a means by which citation elements may be
   identified and tagged using RDFa attributes within HTML and XML
   formatted citations, allowing an application to extract them in a
   systematic manner.
:  Read the [latest public draft](//fhiso.org/TR/cev-rdfa-bindings) or
   [download as a PDF](//fhiso.org/TR/cev-rdfa-bindings.pdf).

Citations: Goals and Considerations

:  This document surveys requirements that have been expressed for
   a citations standard; high-level designs that have been proposed;
   and which requirements each design is suited to handle.
:  Read the [latest public draft](//fhiso.org/TR/citation-goals) or
   [download as a PDF](//fhiso.org/TR/citation-goals.pdf).

Citation Elements: Bindings for GEDCOM

:  This document defines how citation elements should be represented in
   FamilySearch GEDCOM 7.0.
:  No draft of this document has yet been released.

Citation Elements: Bindings for GEDCOM X

:  This document defines extensions to the GEDCOM X data model and its
   JSON and XML serialisations to allow citation elements to be
   represented in GEDCOM X.
:  No draft of this document has yet been released.

Citation Elements: Vocabulary

:  This document defines a collection of citation elements allowing the
   representation of information normally found in formatted citations
   to diverse types of source.
:  No draft of this document has yet been released.

General Utility Components                                       {#util}
--------------------------

Basic Concepts for Genealogical Standards

:  This document defines various low-level concepts, including those to
   relating to our use of strings and IRIs.  It also defines the
   abstract foundations of our data model.  This is content which will
   be used in many FHISO standards and so does not logically belong in
   any one particular higher-level standard.
:  Read the [latest public draft](//fhiso.org/TR/basic-concepts) or 
   [download as a PDF](//fhiso.org/TR/basic-concepts.pdf).

The Pattern Datatype

:  This document defines a dialect of regular expressions that is
   readily handled by many different regular expression engines,
   suitable for use in discovery and basic datatype validation.
:  Read the [latest public draft](//fhiso.org/TR/patterns) or 
   [download as a PDF](//fhiso.org/TR/patterns.pdf).

Simple Triples Discovery Mechanism

:  This document defines a simple, general-purpose discovery mechanism
   which provides a means for internet-connected applications to access
   information on any unfamiliar third-party extensions which they may
   encounter.
:  Read the [latest public draft](//fhiso.org/TR/triples-discovery) or
   [download as a PDF](//fhiso.org/TR/triples-discovery.pdf).


Concluded or suspended efforts
----------------------------

Extended Legacy Format (ELF)

:  Prior to the release of FamilySearch GEDCOM 7.0 FHISO engaged in
   defining an Extended Legacy Format (ELF) that was backwards-compatible
   with GEDCOM 5.5.1 but clearer and with added extensibility
   features needed to bind the same citation standard to GEDCOM and GEDCOM-X.
   FHISO's work on ELF helped prompt the creation of the GEDCOM 7.0 project,
   which included FHISO members who included those extensibility features
   in the 7.0 specification. As such, the ELF project was suspended.

   One public draft was produced as part of the ELF project:

   Extended Legacy Format (ELF): Date, Age and Time Microformats

   :  This document defines microformats for representing dates, ages and
      times in arbitrary calendars together with how they are applied to
      the Gregorian, Julian, French Republican and Hebrew calendars in a
      GEDCOM-compatible manner.
