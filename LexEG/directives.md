Directives of the Lexicon Exploratory Group
===========================================

*Approved by the Technical Standing Committee and published on 2 October 2014.*

1\.  Mission							{#mission}
------------

The Lexicon Exploratory Group (LexEG) of the Family History Information
Standards Organisation, Inc. (FHISO) is tasked with carrying out
exploratory work, as defined in section 1.2 of the Technical Standing
Committee (TSC) Operations and Policy Manual (O&PM), into common usage
and best practices for genealogical terminology in the English language.

The LexEG shall compile a lexicon of terms and concepts in current
use in genealogy and other disciplines relevant to FHISO's work.
This lexicon is initially intended to help avoid ambiguity and confusion
in the during future FHISO work.  The lexicon shall document where a
given term has multiple uses, and where multiple terms are used for a
single concept.  Where possible it shall provide sources for lexicon
entries.  The LexEG may choose to distinguish best practice from common
usage when best practice has been identified by a competent and
respected authority external to FHISO.  

As other technical groups (TGs) develop recommendations and eventually
standards they will need to establish the preferred vocabulary for the
concepts in their work.  This process will be instigated in TGs other
than the LexEG; however the LexEG shall liaise with the other TGs in
order to ensure that the preferred vocabulary is:

1. in line with best practices identified in the lexicon;
2. used consistently by each TG; and
3. is unlikely to be confusing by being at odds with common usage.

The LexEG shall maintain a list of FHISO's preferred terminology
together with the status of the work proposing it.  This list may be
included within the lexicon.  

The LexEG shall avoid implying that any choice of preferred terminology
is final until it has been used in a FHISO standard that has been
published in accordance with section 1.6 of the O&PM.


2\. Operation							{#operation}
-------------

The LexEG shall ordinarily conduct its business on the public
lexicon@fhiso.org mailing list.  The LexEG may, after consultation with
the TSC, conduct business or hold meetings in other manners, providing it
is consistent with principles of the standards development process given
in section 6 of the O&PM.

Although the lexicon may need revision continually, the LexEG are
encouraged to work towards publishing a reasonably complete snapshot in
the form of one or more Technical Group Notes (TGN) that will provide
third parties and other FHISO groups with a stable point of reference
for situations where that is desirable.

Work may be prioritised and divided as the LexEG sees fit.  If the
pattern of work is such that self-contained part of the lexicon (such as
the entries on a particular subject) is completed ahead of the whole
lexicon, the LexEG are encouraged to publish a TGN as a fascicle of the
lexicon.

All deliverables produced by the LexEG shall comply with the policies
given in section 5 of the O&PM, and with any style guides that in the
future be approved by the TSC or by FHISO's Executive Committee.  The
TSC shall maintain as annex A.3 to these Directives a record of all
deliverables produced by the LexEG.

The LexEG Coordinator shall keep concise minutes of the decisions made by
the LexEG, and other events deemed worthy of record.  The LexEG
Coordinator should liaise with the TSC to ensure these are made public
no more than a month after the events being minuted.  This task may be
delegated to a Recorder appointed by the LexEG Coordinator.


3\. Governance							{#governance}
--------------

The work of the LexEG shall be supervised by the TSC and is governed by
the policies given in sections 2 and 3 of the O&PM, and section 4 of the
TSC Charter.  The TSC shall appoint an Coordinator for the LexEG, 
who shall be identified in annex A.1 of these Directives.

The TSC shall maintain as annex A.1 of these Directives a list of
members of the LexEG, which shall distinguish associate and transitional
members.  The TSC shall inform the LexEG Coordinator of changes to this
list.  The LexEG Coordinator is responsible for informing the TSC if in
the LexEG Coordinator's opinion a member lapses into or reverts from
transitional status.  If other formal roles are established in the
LexEG, these shall be communicated to the TSC and identified in annex
A.1.

All members of the LexEG must abide by FHISO's Code of Conduct.


4\. Potential for a Project Team				{#project-team}
--------------------------------

The LexEG is an exploratory group and as such does not produce documents
which are intended to be accepted by the vote of the full membership of FHISO.
At the time the LexEG was organised, its mission was primarily documenting
current practice and no need for a voted-on standard was anticipated.

If, however, the LexEG determines that a formal standard lexicon is warranted
they may produce a Project Proposal outlining the rationale for such a
standards-producing effort together with the scope and directives to which
the proposed Project Team(s) would be subject.
