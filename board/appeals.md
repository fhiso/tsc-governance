FHISO Appeals Process Policy
============================

*This is a **draft** of a new policy.*

FHISO's goal, as stated in Bylaw 3.2, is to "work transparently and
collaboratively" towards the development of "consensus-based technical
standards".  It is inevitable that from time to time this will result in
disagreements.  Ordinarily they should be resolved by discussion and
consensus-building within the group where the disagreement arises.  This
policy documents FHISO's appeals process for when serious
grievances remain that cannot be resolved through consesus-building.

This document is the Appeals Process Policy referred to in Bylaw 18.

Instigating an Appeal
---------------------

Any person or persons ("the Appellants") who is dissatisified with
actions or decisions made by individuals, committees, teams or groups
acting as part of FHISO may instigate a formal appeal.  The appeal shall
be filed in writing with the Chair who will
serve as Appeal Coordinator.

The appeal shall identify the specific actions or decisions that are
being appealed ("the Appealed Action"), the person, persons or body who
made the decision ("the Appellees"), and the grounds for appealing the
decision.  If the Appealed Action came about as an attempt to resolve a
dispute then the parties to original dispute shall be identified as
Third Parties to the appeal.

Appeals may alternatively be filed with the Vice-Chair who will serve as
Appeal Coordinator if:

a.  the Chair is taking a sabbatical per Bylaw 9.15 or is otherwise
    unavailable, or the office of Chair is vacant; 
b.  the Chair has already summarily dismissed the appeal under
    section 2 of this policy; or
c.  if the Chair is an Appellee or was otherwise directly involved in
    the Appealed Action.

Summary Dismissal of Appeals
----------------------------

The Appeal Coordinator may (but is not required to) summarily dismiss an
appeal if at their sole discretion:

a.  the Appellants do not agree to abide by FHISO's Code of Conduct;
b.  the Appellant fails to identify with sufficient specificity the
    Appealed Action or the grounds for the appeal;
c.  FHISO was not responsible, directly or indirectly, for the
    Appealed Action;
d.  the appeal is frivolous or vexatious, and either the Appellant is
    not a member of FHISO or is a member who has had their right to
    appeal removed by a previous Appeal Committee per ยง6 of this policy;
e.  the appeal concerns a matter that has already been settled by an
    Appeal Committee; 
f.  the appeal was filed with the Vice-Chair other than in the
    circumstances listed in ยง1;
g.  the Appellee is the Board and the Appellant does not allege
    the Appealed Action to be contrary to the Bylaws and Articles of
    Incorporation of FHISO, or applicable law; 
h.  the Appealed Action is judged by the Appeal Coordinator to be
    primarily of a technical nature, and the matter has not been
    considered by the Technical Standing Committee (TSC); or
i.  the Appealed Action and the grounds for appeal are both judged
    by the Appeal Coordinator to be wholly of a technical nature, the
    Appellant does not allege the Appealed Action to be contrary to
    established Board policy, the TSC Charter, the Bylaws and Articles of
    Incorporation of FHISO, or applicable law, and the TSC was
    responsible for or has otherwise approved the Appealed Action.

Any decision to summarily dismiss an appeal shall be made and
communicated to the Appellant together with one or more of the above
reasons within fourteen days of the appeal being filed.  The Appeal
Coordinator shall file a copy of the appeal and the decision to
summarily dismiss it with the Secretary.

Later sections of this policy shall not apply to appeals that have been
summarily dismissed.

Parties to the Appeal
---------------------

The Parties to the Appeal shall consist of the Appellants, the
Appellees and any Third Parties identified by the Appellant.  Additional
individuals, committees, teams or groups may be added as Parties to the
Appeal, as appears appropriate to the Appeal Coordinator.

Within fourteen days of the appeal being filed, the Appeal Coordinator
shall provide all Parties to the Appeal with a copy of the appeal as
filed by the Appellants.  In exceptional circumstances parts of this may
be redacted.  The Appeal Coordinator shall invite responses in writing
from Parties to the Appeal other than the Appellants, and shall give a
deadline for responses which will not normally be less than fourteen
days from when the Parties to the Appeal were notified.  The Appeal
Coordinator shall notify the Board of the appeal.

Appeal Committee
----------------

By the deadline for responses to the appeal, the Appeal Coordinator
shall have formed an Appeal Committee to consider the appeal.  The
Appeal Committee shall consist of those members of the Board who are not
taking a sabbatical under Bylaw 9.15 and are not Parties to the Appeal.
Additionally, Board members who are on sabbatical may opt to join the
Appeal Committee by notifying the Appeal Coordinator, providing they are
not Parties to the Appeal.

For the purpose of constituting the Appeal Committee, a Board member who
is a member of a committee, team or group that is a Party to the Appeal
is considered to be a Party to the Appeal themself and is therefore
excluded from the Appeal Committee.

Members of the Appeal Committee may recuse themselves, thereby ceasing
to be a member of it, if their impartiality might reasonably be
questioned.  A member of the Appeal Committee may be removed for cause
by a two-thirds vote of the Appeal Committee.

If the Appeal Coordinator is a Party to the Appeal, or has been recused
or removed, the Appeal Committee shall elect one of their number to
serve as Appeal Coordinator instead.

If the Appeal Committee consists of fewer than three members, the appeal
shall instead be considered by the Board of FHISO, and the words Appeal
Committee and Appeal Coordinator in subsequent sections of this policy
shall be interpretted as meaning the Board of Directors and the Chair,
respectively.

Consideration of the Appeal
---------------------------

The Appeal Committee shall consider the appeal filed by the Appellants
and the responses received from other Parties to the Appeal.  The Appeal
Committee may structure their consideration as by majority vote they
deem fit.  In particular, they may:

a.  seek clarification or supplementary information from the Parties to
    the Appeal;
b.  allow further written or verbal submissions by the Parties to the
    Appeal;
c.  add or remove Third Parties to the appeal;
d.  arrange mediation or informal discussion sessions between the
    Parties to the Appeal; or
e.  seek expert advice.

In considering the appeal, the Appeal Committee must ensure that
Appellants and Appellees are treated equally, insofar as circumstances
allow.  The Appeal Committee is bound by FHISO's Non-discrimination
Policy.

If two similar appeals are being (or would be) considered concurrently,
they may be considered together by a single combined Appeal Committee if
both separate Appeal Committees determine by majority vote that this
would be expedient.  If an Appeal Committee has yet to be constituted,
this determination is that the sole discretion of the Appeal
Coordinator.

The Appeal Committee has no budget unless otherwise provided by the
Board.  Expenditures are limited to those items included in the approved
budget or separately authorised by the Treasurer.

The Appeal Committee may take as long as necessary to reach a
conclusion, but must meet at once every thirty days and provide all
Parties to the Appeal with updates on its deliberations at least once
every thirty days.

The Appeal Coordinator shall appoint a Recorder to take minutes of the
Appeal Committee's deliberations and actions.  

Decisions in an Appeal
----------------------

The Appeal Committee shall by majority vote reach a Decision covering
all matters raised by the Appellants in the appeal and any directly
related issues arising from the appeal.  

Except in appeals considered by the full Board per ยง4, the Appeal
Committee shall not: 

a. require any committee, team or group to exceed their budget without
   authorisation by the Board;
b. reverse any policy decisions made by the Board unless it is contrary
   to the Bylaws and Articles of Incorporation of FHISO, or applicable
   law; or
c. reverse any technical decision made by the TSC except where it is
   contrary to, or was reached via a process contrary to, established
   Board policy, the TSC Charter, the Bylaws and Articles of
   Incorporation of FHISO, or applicable law.

If in the circumstances enumerated above it is the decision of the
Appeal Committee that a technical decision by the TSC or a policy
decision by the Board needs reversing, the Appeal Committee shall direct
the TSC or Board to reconsider their decision, and may specify the
process to be followed or what additional facts or views to take into
account when reconsidering the decision, but shall not determine the
result of that reconsideration.

In extreme circumstances, the Appeal Committee may by two-thirds vote
apply such sanctions as are deemed apporpriate against a person who is a
Party to the Appeal.  For the purpose of determining whether a
two-thirds vote is required, a sanction is defined as any decision that
restricts a person's future activities or interactions with FHISO; the
Appeal Coordinator's interpretation in this matter is final.  Available
sactions include restricting the activies they may participate in or the
manner of their participation, determining them no longer to be "in good
standing" for the purpose of Bylaw 5.1, or removing their right to
future appeal.  The Appeal Committee shall not impose a sanction other
than one which the Board could by majority vote impose.

A written copy of the Decision shall be provided to all Parties to the
Appeal.  In exceptional circumstances parts of this may be redacted from
some or all copies.  The Parties to the Appeal shall have fourteen days
in which to seek clarification on any part of the Decision which is
unclear.  The Appeal Committee shall respond to all requests for
clarification within fourteen days, and may amend the Decision as a
result.

Decisions made by Appeal Committees are binding and may not be appealed
further.  Decisions may exceptionally be overruled by a two-thirds vote
of the Board.

Copies of the initial appeal, the responses, any further submissions
from Parties to the Appeal, any written expert advice received, the
Appeal Committee minutes, and an unredacted copy of the final Decision
of the Appeal Committee shall be filed with the Secretary, and made
available on demand to future Appeal Committees.  The Appeal Committee
should clearly identify what parts of this material may at the
Secretary's discretion be made public.  The Secretary shall keep an
index of all Appeal Committee Decisions which shall be readily
accessible to the Board of Directors.

Once all requests for clarification of the Decision have been handled
or fourteen days have elapsed without any such requests, and the
required materials have been filed with the secretary, the Appeal
Committee shall be disbanded.

Changes to this Policy
----------------------

This policy may be updated by the Board of Directors at any time.  If
there are any appeals in progress at the time, the Board of Directors
shall indicate whether they are to be governed by the updated policy or
the version that was in force when the appeal was filed.
