List of Public Drafts
=====================

FHISO is currently working towards a suite of standards covering
citations and legacy data formats.  We are happy to announce that
several drafts have reached the point where we would like to encourage
comment and feedback from interested parties.  The [**tsc-public**
mailing list](tsc-public) is the preferred place for discussing this
work.

Extended Legacy Format (ELF)                                      {#elf}
----------------------------

Extended Legacy Format (ELF): Serialisation Format

:  This document defines a file format that is fully compatible with
   GEDCOM, but with the addition of a structured, IRI-based
   extensibility mechanism which will be used in other FHISO
   specifications.

Extended Legacy Format (ELF): Date, Age and Time Microformats

:  This document defines microformats for representing dates, ages and
   times in arbitrary calendars together with how they are applied to
   the Gregorian, Julian, French Republican and Hebrew calendars in a
   GEDCOM-compatible manner.

Extended Legacy Format (ELF): Data Model

:  This document reformulates the tags of the lineage-linked GEDCOM form
   as an ELF data model, in the process clarifying its ambiguities and
   documenting best current practice.

Citation Elements                                                 {#cev}
-----------------

Citation Elements: General Concepts

:  This document defines the general concepts used in FHISO's suite of
   Citation Elements standards, and the basic framework and data model
   underpinning them.
:  Read the [latest public draft](//fhiso.org/TR/cev-concepts) or 
   [download as a PDF](//fhiso.org/TR/cev-concepts.pdf).

Citation Elements: Bindings for RDFa

:  This document defines a means by which citation elements may be
   identified and tagged using RDFa attributes within HTML and XML
   formatted citations, allowing an application to extract them in a
   systematic manner.
:  Read the [latest public draft](//fhiso.org/TR/cev-rdfa-bindings) or 
   [download as a PDF](//fhiso.org/TR/cev-rdfa-bindings.pdf).

Citation Elements: Bindings for ELF

:  This document defines how citation elements should be represented in
   FHISO's Extensible Legacy Format (ELF), a format based on and
   compatible with GEDCOM, but with the addition of a new extensibility
   mechanism. 

Citation Elements: Bindings for GEDCOM X

:  This document defines extensions to the GEDCOM X data model and its
   JSON and XML serialisations to allow citation elements to be
   represented in GEDCOM X.

Citation Elements: Vocabulary

:  This document defines a collection of citation elements allowing the
   representation of information normally found in formatted citations
   to diverse types of source.

General Utility Components                                       {#util}
--------------------------

Basic Concepts for Genealogical Standards

:  This document defines various low-level concepts, including those to
   relating to our use of strings and IRIs.  It also defines the
   abstract foundations of our data model.  This is content which will
   be used in many FHISO standards and so does not logically belong in
   any one particular higher-level standard.
:  Read the [latest public draft](//fhiso.org/TR/basic-concepts) or 
   [download as a PDF](//fhiso.org/TR/basic-concepts.pdf).

The Pattern Datatype

:  This document defines a dialect of regular expressions that is
   readily handled by many different regular expression engines,
   suitable for use in discovery and basic datatype validation.
:  Read the [latest public draft](//fhiso.org/TR/patterns) or 
   [download as a PDF](//fhiso.org/TR/patterns.pdf).

Simple Triples Discovery Mechanism

:  This document defines a simple, general-purpose discovery mechanism
   which provides a means for internet-connected applications to access
   information on any unfamiliar third-party extensions which they may
   encounter.
:  Read the [latest public draft](//fhiso.org/TR/triples-discovery) or 
   [download as a PDF](//fhiso.org/TR/triples-discovery.pdf).
