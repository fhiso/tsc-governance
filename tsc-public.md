tsc-public mailing list
=======================

The **tsc-public** mailing list is a place for general discussion on the
technical work of the FHISO.   Comments on [paper submissions](cfps/papers),
the work of the [Technical Standing Committee](/) (TSC), and the creation of
future [exploratory groups](egs) (EGs) are all appropriate for this list, as
are comments of a more general nature.  Previous posts to tsc-public can be
read in the 
[**list archives**](http://fhiso.org/pipermail/tsc-public_fhiso.org/).

You do not have to be a member of FHISO to 
[**subscribe**](http://fhiso.org/mailman/listinfo/tsc-public_fhiso.org).
We ask only that everyone obeys FHISO's 
[code of conduct](http://fhiso.org/aboutfhiso/code-of-conduct/).

Guidelines on list usage 	{#guidelines}
------------------------

The following guidelines are not intended as hard-and-fast rules, but if
everyone considers them when posting, the list will operate more
smoothly.

### 1. Generate ideas, don't seek consensus

Consensus building takes place in [exploratory groups](egs).

### 2. Permit disagreements

Once two people have expressed their differing opinions and understand
that the disagreement exists, move on. In due course, the topic will be
reopened for consideration by an EG and the apparent outcome of the
discussion here will not prejudice the EG's work.

### 3. Consider writing a Call for Papers Submission

If you have a lot to say, please consider writing a paper for our 
[CFPS](cfps).  Diagrams and tables can aid understanding, but are less easily
included in emails.  By taking your time to express your idea clearly, it is
more likely that other people will understand you.

### 4. Brevity

Emails are written once, read many times.  Invest the time during
writing to make them easy to read quickly.

### 5. tsc-public is not a repository

The TSC are not maintaining an index of discussion on this list, and 
[EGs](egs) will not be expected to recall everything here.
Once the idea is generated and voiced here, either send it to the
appropriate EG or submit it in a [CFPS](cfps).  The TSC's [charter](charter)
guarantees that all CFPS papers will receive due consideration and a reasoned
response.

### 6. New topic, new subject line

Don't re-use "Re: Some other idea" for your new ideas.

### 7. Quote your context and only your context

Don't make people guess what you are replying to, neither by quoting
nothing nor by quoting extraneous parts of an earlier email.
