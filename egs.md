Exploratory Groups
==================

**Note:** It was originally envisaged that FHISO's initial technical
work would be carried out in exploratory groups (EGs), each focusing on
a specific aspect of the FHISO's work.  Following a simplification in
our [administrative structure](/governance), this is no longer the case,
and these exploratory groups are **inactive**.

Established exploratory groups {#established}
------------------------------

### Sources and Citations Exploratory Group {#sources}

Status
:   Proposed by the TSC on 2014-08-15 and created on 2015-04-10
    **Suspended** as of 2016-03-22.
Mission
:   To cary out exploratory work regarding data representation of
    information about and information contained within individual
    documents, monuments, artefacts, interviews, and other sources of
    data of interest to family history. [[See more…](sceg)]

### Lexicon Exploratory Group {#lex}

Status
:   Proposed by Tony Proctor on 2014-08-26 and created on 2014-10-02.
Mission
:   To produce a lexicon of common usage and best practices for
    genealogical terminology in the English language. [[See
    more…](lexeg)]

### Core Concepts Exploratory Group {#core}

Status
:   Proposed by the TSC on 2014-08-15 and created on 2014-09-23.
    **Suspended** as of 2015-06-19.
Mission
:   To carry out exploratory work into the core genealogical concepts
    pertaining to persons, their intrinsic and extrinsic properties, the
    events in their lives, and the relationships they have with other
    persons. [[See more…](cceg)]

### Modularisation Exploratory Group {#mod}

Status
:   Proposed by the TSC on 2014-08-15
Focus
:   It will be necessary to have separate project teams working on
    different aspects of the proposed standard, but is it best to
    publish a single monolithic standard, or is it preferable to divide
    it into separate modules? Can different modules be published and
    updated according to different release schedules? What implications
    does this have for forwards and backwards compatibility? Is it
    acceptable for applications to support only some modules? Is there a
    place for niche modules developed outside the FHISO? What about
    vendor extensions? What consequences does this have for
    interoperability?

### Data Formalism Exploratory Group {#formal}

Status
:   Proposed by the TSC on 2014-08-15
Focus
:   We will need a way of describing our data model: what should it be?
    Should we think about objects with a list of properties as in a SQL
    database? Should it be a list of statements linking a subject and
    object as in the Semantic Web? Or do we not need an abstract means
    of describing the data model: do we simply document a serialisation
    format as GEDCOM does? Are there standard formalisms that can be
    used without imposing a particular choice of serialisation format?
    How do we specify type constraints: for example that the parent of
    an individual is another individual and not an event or a date?

How to propose a new exploratory group {#new}
--------------------------------------

The TSC is not soliciting proposals for new exploratory groups to allow
us to concentrate on our [current priorities](/priorities).
