Minutes of the Technical Standing Committee
===========================================

**2017-06-08** Approved [vocabularies policy](/policies/vocabularies) as
a FHISO technical policy, and an updated [priorities](/priorities)
document as a non-binding indication of the TSC's current direction.
Also approved the creation of a [Technical Project
Team](/governance/tpt) as a formal means of allowing the current
exploratory work to continue into the project development phase in a
"committee of the whole".

**2017-05-29** Noted that Luther had produced first exploratory drafts
of an [ELF: Serialization Format](/drafts/elf-serialization) and [ELF:
Data Model](/drafts/elf-data-model).  These did not currently include an
extensibility mechanism.

**2017-05-25** Noted that Richard had produced a first exploratory draft
of a [Citation Elements: General Concepts and Basic 
Framework](/drafts/cev-concepts) standard, and had closed the
`dev-2017-01` branch.  The draft does not currently support layererd
citations.

**2017-05-22** Noted that Richard had produced a first exploratory draft
of a [Citation Elements: RDFa bindings](/drafts/cev-rdfa-bindings)
standard.

**2017-05-19** Noted that Richard had made available a first exploratory
draft of a [Citation Elements: GEDCOM X
bindings](/drafts/cev-gedcomx-bindings) standard.  Further work is
required before becoming a public draft as this draft is based on an
earlier version of the data model without translation sets.

**2017-05-17** Held a TSC meeting by Google Hangout.  During a
productive conversation about the serialisation of citation elements it
was recognised that users may be reluctant to discard formatted citation
in favour of citation element sets due to the work that goes into
producing professional formatted citations.  Could we allow elements to
be tagged in a formatted citation?  It was agreed to explore the use of
RDFa atributes in HTML as a possible means of doing this.

**2017-02-16** Held a TSC meeting by Google Hangout.  

*  Agreed that the scope of our initial ELF standards should be limited
   to clarifying ambiguities in GEDCOM, codifying current practice,
   updating its presentation, and adding an extension mechanism; other
   extensions and changes would be out of scope.  
*  Agreed that the ELF spec should be split in two with the abstract
   syntax and the genealogical tag list being separate standards.  
*  Noted that Richard had made some progress on citation elements on the
   `dev-2017-01` branch in Github, and had introduced the concept of a
   translation set to resolve problems in the data model with citation
   elements that were both translatable and multi-valued.

**2017-01-31** Noted that Luther than produced a first exploratory draft
of an ELF standard.

**2016-12-27** Identified our current technical priorities to be: 

1.  a core citation element vocabulary (CEV) standard; 
2.  a less technical primer or overview to the CEV and its bindings; 
3.  CEV bindings for GEDCOM X; 
4.  CEV bindings for ELF; and 
5.  an ELF extensibility mechanism.

**2016-12-26** Proposed that FHISO develop a serialisation format that
is backwards compatibility with current GEDCOM, but that supports an
extensibility mechanism that would prevent different vendors' extensions
from conflicting.  After informal discussion with the Board, the working
name ELF (Extended Legacy Format) has been chosen for this work to avoid
any intellectual property issues that might arise by calling it a
version of GEDCOM.

**2016-12-15** Instigated discussion with the Board regarding the how
FHISO's present proposed technical work would fit into the wider
genealogical ecosystem, and why vendors might choose to adopt our work.

**2016-11-11** Held a phone meeting to try to kick-start development
again, and to remind ourselves where we had reached.

**2016-05-09**
[Announced](/pipermail/tsc-public_fhiso.org/2016-May/005022.html)
a first exploratory draft of the introduction to the Citation Element
Vocabulary standard, giving details of the data model.

**2016-04-19** Proposed and had passed
[a motion](http://fhiso.org/minutes/2016-04-19/#MotionE) at the Board
Meeting to add by-laws material regarding the ratification of standards
(which was previously in the O&PM but should not be within the scope of
the TSC to change).

**2016-04-19** Proposed and had passed
[a motion](http://fhiso.org/minutes/2016-04-19/#MotionD) at the Board
Meeting to remove reference to details of technical governance, such as
the O&PM and Project Teams.

**2016-03-22** Suspended the [S&CEG](/egs#sources) in order to focus on
our [priorities](/priorities) in a "committee of the whole" per our 
[interim governance structure](/governance).

**2016-02-17**
[Announced](/pipermail/tsc-public_fhiso.org/2016-February/002113.html)

we work towards our new [priorities](/priorities).

**2016-02-16** Approved our [priorities](/priorities) and [technical
strategy](/strategy) documents as non-binding statements of TSC guidance.

wider comment on tsc-public.

strategy](/strategy), and [vocabularies policy](/policies/vocabularies)
at the [19 January Board meeting](/fhiso-board/minutes/2015-11-27/), where it
was agreed that we should make any final changes and release them to
[tsc-public](/tsc-public) for further discussion.

**2016-01-07** Produced a short draft document listing [our immediate
priorities](/priorities), and a longer draft [technical strategy
paper](/strategy).

**2015-12-07** Published a draft policy on the [prefered use of
vocabularies](/policies/vocabularies), and amended the [style
guide](/policies/style) to say that "FHISO standards will normally be
made available in both HTML and PDF formats".

**2015-11-27** Noted that the [27 November Board
meeting](/aboutfhiso/fhiso-board/minutes/2015-11-27/), in consultation
with the TSC, recommended: 

*  that the TSC should produce a short high-level strategy paper; 
*  that technical work should focus on narrow citations standards
   covering vocabularies for textual citation elements and, less
   pressingly, describing source derivation; 
*  that the TSC should draft a general policy on the preferred nature of
   vocabularies, such as the use of URIs; and 
*  that these TSC minutes should be made public.

**2015-11-22** Deployed the new [technical
website](http://tech.fhiso.org/).

**2015-11-21** Thanked the Board for approving the updated [Operations &
Policy Manual](/opm).

metadata identifiers.

**2015-06-19** Suspended the [CCEG](/egs#core) in order to
prioritise the work of the [S&CEG](/egs#sources); the CCEG mailing
list had been silent for three months, they have no Coordinator, and
none of its members have been active recently.

**2015-06-15** Reported to the [S&CEG](/egs#sources) on a [possible
