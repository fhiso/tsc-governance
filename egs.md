Exploratory Groups
==================

Much of the initial technical work of the FHISO is being carried out in
exploratory groups (EGs), each focusing on a specific aspect of the
FHISO's work. The aim of these EGs is not to produce a finished
standard, but to research current practice, to determine if and how to
proceed with standardisation, and to produce a recommendation on the
broad substance of a future FHISO standard. Non-members are welcome to
participate in the work of these exploratory groups, and any interested
parties contribute on the group mailing lists. As a non-member you will
not be eligible to participate in any formal votes, however individuals
can [join the FHISO](http://fhiso.org/join-fhiso/) for an annual payment of
US\$20 and then participate fully.

Established exploratory groups {#established}
------------------------------

The first EGs have recently commenced work. If you would like to
participate in an open collaborative process to build consensus in these
areas, the [TSC](/ "Technical Standing Committee") would welcome your
involvement on the EGs' mailing lists.

### Sources and Citations Exploratory Group {#sources}

Status
:   Proposed by the TSC on 2014-08-15 and created on 2015-04-10
Mission
:   To cary out exploratory work regarding data representation of
    information about and information contained within individual
    documents, monuments, artefacts, interviews, and other sources of
    data of interest to family history. [[See more…](sceg)]

### Lexicon Exploratory Group {#lex}

Status
:   Proposed by Tony Proctor on 2014-08-26 and created on 2014-10-02.
Mission
:   To produce a lexicon of common usage and best practices for
    genealogical terminology in the English language. [[See
    more…](lexeg)]

### Core Concepts Exploratory Group {#core}

Status
:   Proposed by the TSC on 2014-08-15 and created on 2014-09-23.
    Suspended as of 2015-06-19.
Mission
:   To carry out exploratory work into the core genealogical concepts
    pertaining to persons, their intrinsic and extrinsic properties, the
    events in their lives, and the relationships they have with other
    persons. [[See more…](cceg)]

Proposed exploratory groups {#proposed}
---------------------------

The TSC are looking for at least three FHISO members willing to commit
to participating actively in each of these proposed EGs. If you are
willing to commit, please email us at <tsc@fhiso.org> to let us know
which group or groups you can commit to participating in. If you want to
discuss the groups more before committing, the [**tsc-public** mailing
list](http://fhiso.org/mailman/listinfo/tsc-public_fhiso.org) is a good
place to do that. Once each group has support from three members, we
will set up the group's mailing list and in due course post an
announcement to the [**tsc-announce** mailing
list](http://fhiso.org/mailman/listinfo/tsc-announce_fhiso.org).

### Modularisation Exploratory Group {#mod}

Status
:   Proposed by the TSC on 2014-08-15
Focus
:   It will be necessary to have separate project teams working on
    different aspects of the proposed standard, but is it best to
    publish a single monolithic standard, or is it preferable to divide
    it into separate modules? Can different modules be published and
    updated according to different release schedules? What implications
    does this have for forwards and backwards compatibility? Is it
    acceptable for applications to support only some modules? Is there a
    place for niche modules developed outside the FHISO? What about
    vendor extensions? What consequences does this have for
    interoperability?

### Data Formalism Exploratory Group {#formal}

Status
:   Proposed by the TSC on 2014-08-15
Focus
:   We will need a way of describing our data model: what should it be?
    Should we think about objects with a list of properties as in a SQL
    database? Should it be a list of statements linking a subject and
    object as in the Semantic Web? Or do we not need an abstract means
    of describing the data model: do we simply document a serialisation
    format as GEDCOM does? Are there standard formalisms that can be
    used without imposing a particular choice of serialisation format?
    How do we specify type constraints: for example that the parent of
    an individual is another individual and not an event or a date?

How to propose a new exploratory group {#new}
--------------------------------------

Perhaps you disagree with our decision to prioritise these particular
areas, or think we should start exploring other areas too? If so, you
might like to start a thread on the [**tsc-public** mailing
list](http://fhiso.org/mailman/listinfo/tsc-public_fhiso.org) to let us
know and to gauge community support for your suggestion. FHISO members
can formally propose new exploratory groups by email to the [TSC](/)
at <tsc@fhiso.org>. Once a proposal has been accepted we will list it on
this page and announce it on the [**tsc-announce** mailing
list](http://fhiso.org/mailman/listinfo/tsc-announce_fhiso.org) to
solicit commitments of support from members as with the groups proposed
above.
