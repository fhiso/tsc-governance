Technical Work
==============

The mission of the [Family History Information Standards
Organisation](//fhiso.org) (FHISO) is to develop **open** and
**international standards** to benefit the genealogical community.

Our current focus is a suite of standards on [**Citation
Elements**](/drafts#cev) to provide an extensible framework and
vocabulary for encoding information about genealogical sources that
normally appears in formatted citations.  These standards will include
bindings for both GEDCOM and [GEDCOM-X](http://www.gedcomx.org/).
Because GEDCOM is unmaintained and has only an *ad hoc* extension
mechanism, we are developing a [**Extended Legacy Format
(ELF)**](/drafts#elf) that is fully compatible with GEDCOM, but
with the addition of a structured extensibility mechanism.

The Technical Standing Committee (TSC) is responsible for coordinating
the organisation's technical work which is currently proceeding in a
under a [simplified governance structure](/governance).  At present the
TSC has three members: 

* Richard Smith, Technical Coordinator
* Seth Taplin, Technical Co-Coordinator
* Luther Tychonievich, TSC Special Member.  

We can be contacted by email at [tsc@fhiso.org](mailto:tsc@fhiso.org).


Get involved {#involve}
------------

We welcome participation from anyone, whether or not a member of FHISO,
who is willing to abide by our [code of
conduct](http://fhiso.org/aboutfhiso/code-of-conduct/). 

### Keep in touch

We recommend that all interested parties subscribe to the
[**tsc-announce** mailing
list](http://fhiso.org/mailman/listinfo/tsc-announce_fhiso.org), which
is a read-only low volume list where technical announcements are posted
by the TSC.

### Join the work

Over the last year, the TSC have been hammering out the technical
details needed of our Citation Elements and ELF standards.  We are happy
to announce that several [drafts](/drafts) have reached the point where
we would like to encourage comment and feedback from interested parties.
The [**tsc-public** mailing list](tsc-public) is the preferred place for
discussing this work.

Current priorities for technical work are outlined in [the priorities
document](/priorities) and discussed in detail in [the strategy
document](/strategy).  These documents will be updated as opportunities,
resources, and member interest change.

### Submit papers

The FHISO is operating a [**call for papers**](cfps). This is our preferred
means of receiving technical proposals, suggestions for functional
requirements, or other detailed comment of the technical work of the TSC. In
due course we aim to consider all the suggestions made in these papers and
respond to them, but this will take time.

### Contribute to our bibliography

We are maintaining an [informal **bibliography**](/bibliography) of
material that might be useful to our standardisation work. Please email
[bibliography@fhiso.org](mailto:bibliography@fhiso.org) with suggestions
of what else should be included.
