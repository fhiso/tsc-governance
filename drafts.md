List of Public Drafts
=====================

FHISO is currently working towards a suite of standards covering
citations and legacy data formats.  We are happy to announce that
several drafts have reached the point where we would like to encourage
comment and feedback from interested parties.  The [**tsc-public**
mailing list](tsc-public) is the preferred place for discussing this
work.

Extended Legacy Format (ELF)                                      {#elf}
----------------------------

Extended Legacy Format (ELF): Serialisation Format

:  This standard defines a file format that is fully compatible with
   GEDCOM, but with the addition of a structured, IRI-based
   extensibility mechanism which will be used in other FHISO
   specifications.

Extended Legacy Format (ELF): Data Model

:  This standard reformulates the tags of the lineage-linked GEDCOM form
   as an ELF data model, in the process clarifying its ambiguities and
   documenting best current practice.

Citation Elements                                                 {#cev}
-----------------

Citation Elements: General Concepts

:  This standard defines the general concepts used in FHISO's suite of
   Citation Elements standards, and the basic framework and data model
   underpinning them.
:  Read the [first public draft](cev-concepts) or 
   [download as a PDF](cev-concepts.pdf).

Citation Elements: Bindings for RDFa

:  This standard defines a means by which citation elements may be
   identified and tagged using RDFa attributes within HTML and XML
   formatted citations, allowing an application to extract them in a
   systematic manner.
:  Read the [first public draft](cev-rdfa-bindings) or 
   [download as a PDF](cev-rdfa-bindings.pdf).

Citation Elements: Bindings for ELF

:  This standard defines how citation elements should be represented in
   FHISO's Extensible Legacy Format (ELF), a format based on and
   compatible with GEDCOM, but with the addition of a new extensibility
   mechanism. 

Citation Elements: Bindings for GEDCOM X

:  This standard defines extensions to the GEDCOM X data model and its
   JSON and XML serialisations to allow citation elements to be
   represented in GEDCOM X.

Citation Elements: Vocabulary

:  This standard defines a collection of citation elements allowing the
   representation of information normally found in formatted citations
   to diverse types of source.
