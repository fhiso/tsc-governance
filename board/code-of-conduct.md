FHISO Code of Conduct
=====================

This Code of Conduct facilitates Family History Information Standards
Organisation’s work carried out in an international, multi-stakeholder
environment. All members of the organisation agree to abide by the Code.

##  We agree to work for the net benefit of the international community
We recognise that the development of standards is for the net benefit of
the international community, over and above the interests of any
individual or organisation. We are committed to advancing standards
within their agreed scope and we will not hinder their development.  

##  We support the consensus–building process
We agree that consensus refers to general agreement among stakeholders
after thoughtful collaboration has addressed material objections to
significant requirements. We acknowledge that consensus does not imply
unanimity and need not always be the result of a formal vote. We support
the consensus building-process, and its various phases of collaboration
by which we identify stakeholder requirements and objections, and allow
for the development of a consensus among the stakeholders.

## We agree to uphold consensus and governance
We will uphold the key principles of standardisation: consensus,
transparency, openness, impartiality, effectiveness, relevance and
coherence.

## We agree to maintain a clear purpose and scope
We are committed to having a clear purpose, scope, objectives, and plan
to ensure the timely development of standards.

## We agree to participate actively and manage effective representation
We agree to actively participate in standards development projects. We
will make our direct contributions to the work through the official
procedures.

## We agree to escalate and resolve disputes
We will identify and escalate disputes in a timely manner to ensure
rapid resolution. We will uphold the agreed dispute resolution
processes.

## We agree to behave ethically
We will act in good faith and with due care and diligence. We will avoid
collusive or anticompetitive behaviour. We will promote a culture of
fair and ethical behaviour.

## We agree to respect others in our meetings
We are committed to respecting others and the professional culture of
international standardization within FHISO. In meetings we are committed
to:

-  conducting meetings by means of electronic communications connections
   or other technology to avoid discriminating against those not present
   in the same location.
-  avoiding discrimination against those whose first language is not
   that in which the meeting is conducted, including that we will
   providing notice and advance distribution of meeting materials
   (agendas, proposals, exhibits, prepared remarks).
-  conducting ourselves in a professional manner.
-  respecting others and their opinions.
-  accepting group decisions.
-  ensuring the views of all (including those whose first language is
   not that of the meeting) are heard and understood.

*In accordance with the FHISO by-laws, this Code of Conduct may be
modified by the FHISO Board from time to time. In part, the FHISO Code
was developed, with permission, from the ISO Code of Conduct for the
technical work, dated 24 July 2011. The ISO Code of Conduct remains
