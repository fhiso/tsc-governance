*This document is a pre-alpha draft posted for internal comment only.*

This document is intended to summarize the current vision of the Technical Standing Committee regarding the immediate priorities of technical work.
It may be updated and changed from time to time as resources, opportunities, perspective, and personnel change.
It is in many respects a summary of the larger [TSC strategy document](/strategy.md).

# Scope vs. Priority

In agreement with the FHISO [bylaws](//fhiso.org/by-laws), the TSC considers all areas where technology and family history intersect and standards may be appropriate to be within the scope of the TSC.
However, as that scope far exceeds immediate resources, the TSC suggests priorities that focus on a smaller subset of that scope at any given time.

If a group desires to work on some task within FHISO's scope but not in line with current priorities, as outlined in this document, they are encouraged to [contact the TSC](mailto:tsc@fhiso.org).
Interest and resources becoming available will generally cause a new topic to become one of the present priorities.

# Current priorities

The following have been identified by the TSC as the current priorities:

1. Build consensus on the nature of vocabularies within future FHISO
standards.  A [draft](/policies/vocabulary) of such a policy is
available.

2. Produce a citation element vocabulary identifying the various
descriptive elements that might reasonably be needed in the algorithmic
construction of citations to family history or genealogical sources.

3. Produce a source derivation vocabulary.
